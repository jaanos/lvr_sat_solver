## Running
When your program is executed, the name of the input and output files should be given as a command-line argument.

If you have input file in folder `input` with name `file.txt` and you want to write the solution in `output` folder with name `out.txt` then your command should look like:
```
python main.py "input/file.txt" "output/out.txt"
```

## Content
All input files (test examples) are in "input" folder. Ouput files are automatically saved in "output" folder.

New examples are based on Graph Colouring problem.
